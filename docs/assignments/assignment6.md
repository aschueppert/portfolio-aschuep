## Study Reports

### Participant 1: Key Moments and Observations

#### Task 1: Create an Account

- **Observation:**  
  The participant created an account quickly without significant trouble. However, upon first entering the website, an error message stating "must be logged in" appeared. The participant glanced at the message, looked slightly confused, and remarked, “Yeah, I’m trying to log in,” before quickly navigating to the correct page to log in.

- **Analysis:**  
  The sign-up process was fairly intuitive, with the only distraction being the error message. To improve the user experience in the future, it may be beneficial to remove this error message.

#### Task 3: Follow User “Chloe”

- **Observation:**  
  The participant seemed confused about where to find a user profile and did not realize that the name was a clickable button. Once the participant clicked on it, they immediately followed the user, indicating that the follow action was more apparent after that interaction.

- **Analysis:**  
  This moment highlighted the need for clearer labeling and contextual cues in the interface. Users may lack confidence in navigation, suggesting that enhancing button visibility and clarity could streamline their interactions.

#### Task 5: Approve a Post and Set Theme

- **Observation:**  
  The participant struggled to locate the post they had just created, having to click several different links before finding their profile and posts. Once they accessed the post, they quickly clicked the checkmark to approve it, though there was a slight hesitation before selecting the set theme button.

- **Analysis:**  
  The difficulty in finding the post underscores a potential design flaw. After creating a post, users are required to navigate to a different location without clear indications or instructions, which can lead to frustration.

#### Conclusion

During the debrief, the participant expressed appreciation for the app's visuals and the concept of collaborative posts. However, they found the website challenging to navigate. They noted that the process from draft to approved post involved many steps, some of which were difficult to follow.

### Participant 2: Key Moments and Observations

#### Task 2: View Post with Theme “Music”

- **Observation:**  
   The participant quickly navigated to the theme page but could not immediately find the music theme in the list. They didn't seem to realize that they could scroll. They decided to use the search bar instead and commented “oh that works really well”.

- **Analysis:**  
   The participant's initial difficulty in finding the music theme suggests that the scroll feature was not immediately apparent. The search function provided a workaround, but improving the visibility of the scroll bar could enhance user experience.

#### Task 3: Follow User “Chloe”

- **Observation:**  
  The participant quickly clicked on the user's name and followed them without any issues. They seemed to understand the process and the purpose of following users. They commented "cool its just like Instagram".

- **Analysis:**  
   The participant's familiarity with social media platforms like Instagram helped them navigate the follow feature with ease. Leveraging existing user knowledge can enhance usability, as seen in this instance.

#### Task 7: Save a Post

- **Observation:**  
  The participant quickly found the save button while viewing a post and clicked on it. When they saw that they needed to first create a save label on another page of the app. They commented “oh that’s a bit annoying. Your app requires a lot of navigating to different pages”.
- **Analysis:**  
   The participant's frustration with the multi-step process to save a post highlights the importance of streamlining user interactions. Reducing the number of steps required to perform common actions can enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

#### Conclusion

During the debrief, the participant mentioned that they enjoyed that the app had many features and that their experience with Instagram as a similar app made it easy to understand. However, they found the navigation between pages cumbersome and suggested that the app could benefit from a more streamlined design.

## Design Flaws/Opportunities

#### 1. **Error Message Upon Initial Visit**

- **Flaw:** The "must be logged in" message confused Participant 1, as they were already attempting to log in.
- **Cause:** This likely occurs because the app is checking that the user is logged in before rendering the main page but the error message is not contextually relevant.
- **Solution:** Removing or modifying the error message so it appears only when needed (e.g., when attempting a restricted action while not logged in) would reduce confusion.
- **Type & Severity:** Linguistic; Minor.

#### 2. **Lack of Clear Navigation Cues for Profile and Posts**

- **Flaw:** Participant 1 had difficulty locating their created post and understanding where to set a theme after drafting it.
- **Cause:** The navigation hierarchy may lack clear labeling or grouping of related actions, leading to excessive back-and-forth steps.
- **Solution:** Implementing clearer visual cues, such as a post-draft summary page with direct links for further actions could improve task flow. In addition could figure out how to keep the user on the same page after creating a post for approving and setting theme.
- **Type & Severity:** Conceptual; Moderate.

#### 3. **Scrolling Visibility on Theme Selection Page**

- **Flaw:** Participant 2 didn’t immediately realize they could scroll to view more themes.
- **Cause:** The scroll bar or scrolling functionality may not be prominent enough, leading users to think the options are limited to what is visible.
- **Solution:** Using a visible scroll bar or an indication that more content is available (e.g., "scroll to see more") would make navigation more intuitive.
- **Type & Severity:** Physical; Minor.

#### 4. **Unclear Clickability of Usernames in Profiles**

- **Flaw:** Participant 1 did not initially realize that clicking on usernames was an action to access profiles.
- **Cause:** Usernames underline on hover in the laptop view but its not viewable on the mobile view which the app is designed for. Thus, there is a lack visual cues to indicate that they’re clickable.
- **Solution:** Making the usernames appear as standard button like other clickable elements could improve user understanding. Alternatively, having members appear as circular profile icons more similar to Instagram could improve cross-platform consistency.
- **Type & Severity:** Physical; Moderate.

#### 5. **Multi-Step Process for Saving a Post**

- **Flaw:** Participant 2 found it frustrating to navigate to another page to create a save label before saving a post, seeing it as unnecessary.
- **Cause:** This extra step likely exists to organize saved posts, but it could slow down interactions and add friction to a common action.
- **Solution:** Streamlining this process by offering the option to create a save label within the post-saving flow could enhance user experience.
- **Type & Severity:** Conceptual; Major.
