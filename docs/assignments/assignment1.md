# Assignment 1: Social Media Need Finding

## Hunch
Despite platforms' personalization algorithms, social media users still view a lot of content that does not align with their current interests. 

## Interviewees 

### Interviewee 1: Gen Alpha Tik-Tok-er
Chloe is a 14-year-old high school student who frequently uses TikTok and Instagram. She regularly posts on both accounts, and most of her followers are of similar age. Chloe will be able to provide perspective on how social media is used by its youngest users and the point of view of someone who uses the apps to share content. I am interested in how Chloe's frequent use affects the apps' ability to predict personalized content. \
Followers (Instagram): 1031\
Following (Instagram): 1233 \
Following (TikTok): 28

### Interviewee 2: Gen X Parent
Janine is a 55-year-old parent who irregularly uses Facebook and Instagram. She makes about 2-3 posts a year about her family and travels, and most of her followers are also parents. Janine will be able to provide a perspective on how social media is used by people two generations older than me. Since I don't use Facebook, it will be interesting to hear her perspective on how she uses Facebook differently from Instagram (which I use frequently). I am also interested in seeing how Janine's irregular use affects the app's ability to predict personalized content. \
Followers (Instagram): 46 \
Following (Instagram): 70 \
Friends (Facebook): 433 

###  Perspectives  Summary
Both interviewees are from different generations and use social media at different frequencies. Chloe is a generation younger than me and uses social media more frequently than I do. Janine is two generations older than me and uses social media less frequently than I do. Both Chloe and Janine use social media apps that I use (Instagram) and social media apps that I don't use (TikTok and Facebook, respectively).

## Interview Summaries

[Raw Interview Notes](/assignments/interview_notes)

### Interview 1
Chloe views Instagram regularly throughout that day for a total of a few hours. Her general goal is to keep up being friends, but realistically, she often uses it to fend off boredom. She says, " I most like seeing people I know," but she also watches comedy skits, lifestyle, and pop culture content. She says she gets recommended by a lot of influencers on Instagram but says, "Unless I know you in real life, I don't care about your personal life." Thus, on Instagram, she mostly likes to follow people she knows or who attend the same school. She says that Instagram can help her stay "connected to a larger community" by showing things happening at her school, such as upcoming events. Conversely, she likes to use TikTok to watch content from people she does not know for entertainment. This difference is reflected in the amount of people she follows on the different apps. She follows ~50x more people on Instagram than TikTok. 

### Interview 2:  Gen X Parent
Janine views Facebook about three times a day for a few minutes during a break. She aims to kill time and catch up with what her friends are doing. She says she mainly likes seeing posts from friends and family and "could without seeing everything else." She knows everyone she follows on Facebook very well (~70%), and for around ~30% of her friends, Facebook is the primary way she keeps up with their lives. Conversely, on Instagram, she mainly follows accounts of people she does not know well (she only knows ~20% of the accounts she follows outside of Instagram). These accounts post pictures of their kid and vacations. On Instagram, she likes to follow accounts posting videos about shopping for clothing, manners advice, craft inspiration, and home renovations. She says she wants to keep a separation with "Facebook about friends and family and Instagram more about outside." Facebook, however, still recommends posts of people she does not follow. These posts mainly include videos of Maltese dogs, rugs, and plants. She mostly enjoys seeing these posts but does not enjoy seeing posts from scam brands, political ads that don't align with her views, and ads that feel like they invaded her privacy. A significant way she also likes to use Facebook is through neighborhood groups. In these groups, people are able to ask questions and get recommendations about things relevant to the neighborhood.

## Design Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: Separate Following Types
Both Janine and Chloe mentioned that they have followers who are their friends and followers who are people that they don't know outside of social media. These followers post very different types of content but are lumped together in most apps. Janine's current solution is to use two different apps, significantly reducing her use as she spends less time on both. To solve this, we could develop a way to separate types of followers into different categories to view separately

### Opportunity 2: Follow Only People You Know 
Chloe and Janine prefer one app over the other for following people they know. While they say their primary goal of using this app is to keep up with their friends, they still look at other content to pass the time (but find this use less rewarding). By designing a social media that only includes people you know, we could reduce this unwanted time wasted on social media.

### Opportunity 3: Choose the Type of Content to View 
Both Chloe and Janine mention different types of content that are recommended to them. They also mention preferring certain types of content at certain times. Conversely, both are also recommended content that they don't enjoy. Rather than combining all recommended content into one feed, we could design a social media platform that separates out different content and provides users with the choice of what to see.
