# Blog 3: Default Settings and Error-Tolerant Design

As someone who also finds the CSC GO machines frustrating, I resonated with many of your points. Your analysis of how the washers and dryers fail to carry over consistent design elements is spot on. The washers have a clear visual grouping that makes it easier to navigate, while the dryers lack that same clarity. I especially agree with your observation about the start button—on the washers, it’s more prominently separated, which makes it much easier to find and press. The dryers, however, blur this separation, making the user experience less intuitive.

Your struggle with selecting heat settings really made me think about one aspect of the design that I’ve always considered a flaw. The default setting on the machines is always the lowest temperature, which has annoyed me because I typically wash my clothes at medium heat. I used to find it frustrating that the machine doesn’t default to what I assumed was the most commonly used temperature. But after reading your concerns about accidentally selecting a higher temperature and potentially ruining your clothes, I realized that this default might actually be an intentional error-tolerant design.

By defaulting to the lowest temperature, the machines ensure that if a user forgets to select a setting, the clothes won’t be damaged by excessive heat. It may not clean them as effectively, but it avoids a worst-case scenario. While this still means extra steps for most users, it’s a smart safeguard that protects against accidental damage.

Next time I’m spending those extra few seconds adjusting the temperature, I’ll have a bit more appreciation for this aspect of the design—even if it’s still a bit inconvenient!
