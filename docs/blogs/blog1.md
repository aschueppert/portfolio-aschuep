# Blog 1: ATM Machine User Testing (in the wild)

Last semester I showed up to Walgreens to pick up a prescription, when they told me that their card reader machine was down, so I needed to pay in cash. “No worries” I thought there was an ATM machine just around that corner. I had never used an ATM machine before, but I had seen other people do it, so I wasn’t too concerned. I walked up to the screen (which was providing absolutely no instructions) and I confidently slid my card in and entered my PIN like I had seen other people do. Then I saw it:

“Invalid PIN.”

Okay, weird. Maybe I mistyped. I tried again, carefully this time.

“Invalid PIN.”

Now I was starting to get frustrated. After the third failed attempt, the ATM coldly warned me that I had one more try before it locked me out. My mind was racing. I knew this was the right PIN. !

Feeling flustered and with a growing line of people behind me, I did the only logical thing—I called my mom.
“Hey, Mom,” I said, lowering my voice to avoid being overheard. “My PIN’s not working at the ATM. I’m using my credit card, and it’s saying—”

“Wait, you’re using your credit card?” she interrupted, and I could hear the amusement in her voice.

“Well, yeah…” I said, puzzled. “What else would I use?”

There was a moment of silence, and then she laughed. “You’re supposed to use your debit card at the ATM! That’s why it’s not working!”

I stood there, stunned, staring at the credit card in my hand. Really? I switched to my debit card, the same PIN, and like magic, the ATM finally dispensed my cash.

“Thanks, Mom,” I mumbled, both relieved and embarrassed.

But as I walked away, I couldn’t help but think: why didn’t the ATM make it clear I was using the wrong card? Instead of giving me vague “Invalid PIN” messages, it could’ve said something like, “This is a credit card. Please use a debit card for withdrawals.” That simple message would’ve saved me from standing there, clueless, and having to call my mom in the first place!

ATMs should be smart enough to tell the difference between credit and debit cards right away. Instead, it acted like it didn’t know the difference, leaving me to figure out the problem myself.

The whole situation was frustrating because it wasn’t just me making a mistake—it was bad design. If the ATM had been clearer, I wouldn’t have wasted all that time and looked ridiculous in front of the people behind me. A simple prompt could’ve saved the day.

As I have spent time implementing the front end of my website, I have thought about error message design. Including testing error messages in user testing is difficult to do because it requires the user doing an action (that some might think is obvious) incorrectly, especially in a case like this where apparently most people would know to use a debit card. However, it is important to consider the user experience of people how are less knowledgeable about the system. As I develop my front end, I have tried my best to include error messages and guidance that will help users navigate the site even if they have never used social media before (the ATM of this analogy).

I am excited to continue to develop my website and learn more about user testing and design. I hope to continue to improve my website and make it as user friendly as possible.
