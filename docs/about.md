# About Me 

Hi guys! I'm Amelia Schueppert, a senior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology (6-7). I grew up in Houston, TX as one of three girls (I'm the middle child!). After MIT, I plan to pursue a pHD in computational biology with a focus on immunology. I love coding, so I am super excited to take 6.104!
