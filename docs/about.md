Hi guys! I'm Amelia Schueppert, a senior at MIT studying computer science and molcular biology (6-7). I grew up in Houston, TX as one of three girls (I'm the middle child!). After MIT, I plan to persue a pHD in computational biology with a focus on immunology. I love coding, so I am super exicted to take 6.1040!
